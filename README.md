## üì• Installation Guide
There are multiple ways to install and experience Re-Console: Legacy.
## 3rd Party Launchers
### Modrinth Launcher (Recommended)

For the easiest possible installation, I recommend using the Modrinth Launcher. It's light, easy to use, reasonably quick, and only takes a few clicks to set up. Once you have it installed, you can install Re-Console: Legacy by searching for the modpack in the Modpacks section.

### Prism/MultiMC
Although more complicated, you can install Prism Launcher from their website. Prism is much more versatile and stronger as a launcher, but has a worse GUI. From there, add an instance and search "Modrinth" for Re-Console: Legacy.


## üêõ How to Report Issues
Please use the issue tracker linked at the top of the page if you are experiencing bugs, crashes, or other issues. Be sure to include necessary information like your hardware/software (such as the GPU and CPU, modpack version and OS) so that it's easier for us to find issues and resolve them.

# ‚≠ê Features

### üîç Accuracy
Re-Console: Legacy comes with the goal of being accurate to the early versions of Legacy Console Edition.
It even has limited world generation!

### ‚úÖ Multiple Title Updates
We currently have 3 Title Updates available, in our beta stage:
- TU1
- TU3
- TU5

With TU7 and TU9 planned for full release. We do not currently have a planned time for when that is.

### üöÄ Performant
Re-Console: Legacy, like its [mother pack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/legacy-minecraft), is built off of and and kept in sync with [Adrenaline](https://modrinth.com/modpack/adrenaline) by [devin](https://modrinth.com/user/devin). This means Re-Console: Legacy comes with all the features within [Adrenaline](https://modrinth.com/modpack/adrenaline), including;
- Improved rendering & game logic performance 
- Improved memory and hardware usage 
- Improved world generation speed 

### ‚öôÔ∏è Source Available

This includes our datapacks, which are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ViolaFlower/RC-L-datapacks), and our resource packs, which are also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ViolaFlower/RC-L-Resources)
