## üì• Installation Guide
There are multiple ways to install and experience Re-Console: Legacy.
## 3rd Party Launchers
### Modrinth Launcher (Recommended)

For the easiest possible installation, I recommend using the Modrinth Launcher. It's light, easy to use, reasonably quick, and only takes a few clicks to set up. Once you have it installed, you can install Re-Console: Legacy by searching for the modpack in the Modpacks section.
### Prism/MultiMC
Although more complicated, you can install Prism Launcher from their website. Prism is much more versatile and stronger as a launcher, but has a worse GUI. From there, add an instance and search "Modrinth" for Re-Console: Legacy.


## üêõ How to Report Issues
Please use the issue tracker linked at the top of the page if you are experiencing bugs, crashes, or other issues. Be sure to include necessary information like your hardware/software (such as the GPU and CPU, modpack version and OS) so that it's easier for us to find issues and resolve them.
